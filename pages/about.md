## About the Collection

The content and subject matter of this collection is drawn largely from a 2019 IU Archives exhibit, *"An Army of Lovers Cannot Be Conquered": Examining the History of LGBTQ Life in Bloomington*. Then-graduate assistant Kennedy Jones cataloged and curated historical materials relating to LGBTQ life in Bloomington dating back as early as the 1960s. This digital collection represents the early stages of digitizing these materials for further documentation of local LGBTQ life, a task with growing urgency given both state and national anti-LGBTQ politics.

The materials digitized here consist largely of newspaper articles from Bloomington and IU-affiliated publications, as well as a few selections of programming materials from LGBTQ-aligned groups and spaces. This selection of materials spans from 1971 to 2004. Every scan in the collection was produced by Evan Hurst (me). All materials digitized here are in posession of the Indiana University-Bloomington University Archives, in use expressly for educational purposes as part of the Digital Libraries graduate course.
