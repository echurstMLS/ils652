## About the Collection

The content and subject matter of this collection is drawn largely from a 2019 IU Archives exhibit, *"An Army of Lovers Cannot Be Conquered": Examining the History of LGBTQ Life in Bloomington*. Then-graduate assistant Kennedy Jones cataloged and curated historical materials relating to LGBTQ life in Bloomington dating back as early as the 1960s. This digital collection represents the early stages of digitizing these materials for further documentation of local LGBTQ life, a task with growing urgency given both state and national anti-LGBTQ politics.

The materials digitized here consist largely of newspaper articles from Bloomington and IU-affiliated publications, as well as a few selections of programming materials from LGBTQ-aligned groups and spaces. This selection of materials spans from 1971 to 2004. Every scan in the collection was produced by Evan Hurst (me). All materials digitized here are in posession of the Indiana University-Bloomington University Archives, in use expressly for educational purposes as part of the Digital Libraries graduate course. 

## Controlled Vocabularies

There are several sets of controlled vocabularies in use due to the variety of themes, locations, and subject matter within this digitized collection. The selections below represent solely the information within these objects; given that this work with the IU Archives might expand, these vocabularies will be refined as needed.

# Locations
The following list includes all locations documented in this collection. When necessary, locations with multiple names are listed in full with the preferred name indicated.

# Subjects


# Community
The `community` property for each object indicates to what groups the object is explicitly (or by clear inference) related. This includes groups based on gender and sexual identities, as well as specific affinity, advocacy, or actvist groups involved in LGBTQ+ politics.
